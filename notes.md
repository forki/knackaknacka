Review where we are in the following cases:
* g before a consonant that isn't n or a hard vowel
* g before a soft vowel, dj, gj, hj, j, lj
* k before a hard vowel
* k before a soft vowel, ck, kj, tj
* n, ng, g before n, 
* ch, -ge, rs, sch, sh, sj, sk, skj, stj
* handling vowels before single/double consonants
* all the spellings for the Spellings for the sje-phoneme /ɧ/

Test change before front vowels: c, j, k, sk
Make consonant lookups
Make all the lookup work

Make sure that the cases of Consonant + Vowel + DoubleConsonant (as in
köttbullar) gets handled correctly, as thsis involves both a softened k as well
as a shortend 'ö'

Sort by the length of the first capture group, for the purpose of creating the
regular expression Is there a way to name a character class, so it doesn't have
to be repeated?

Make sure case is handled correctly.
